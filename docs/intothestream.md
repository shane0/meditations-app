- four qualities can be known as ‘a person of integrity.’ Which four?
  - “There is the case where a person of integrity, when asked, doesn’t reveal another person’s bad points, to say nothing of when unasked. Furthermore, when asked, when pressed with questions, he is one who speaks of another person’s bad points not in full, not in detail, with omissions, holding back….  “Then again, a person of integrity, when unasked, reveals another person’s good points, to say nothing of when asked. Furthermore, when asked, when pressed with questions, he is one who speaks of another person’s good points in full & in detail, without omissions, without holding back….  “Then again, a person of integrity, when unasked, reveals his own bad points, to say nothing of when asked. Furthermore, when asked, when pressed with questions, he is one who speaks of his own bad points in full & in detail, without omissions, without holding back….  “Then again, a person of integrity, when asked, doesn’t reveal his own good points, to say nothing of when unasked. Furthermore, when asked, when pressed with questions, he is one who speaks of his own good points not in full, not in detail, with omissions, holding back….  “Monks, a person endowed with these four qualities can be known as ‘a person of integrity.’” —AN 4:73
- [1] “‘It’s through living together that a person’s virtue may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was said. And in reference to what was it said?  “There is the case where one individual, through living with another, knows this: ‘For a long time this person has been torn, broken, spotted, splattered in his actions. He hasn’t been consistent in his actions. He hasn’t practiced consistently with regard to the precepts. He is an unprincipled person, not a virtuous, principled one.’ And then there is the case where one individual, through living with another, knows this: ‘For a long time this person has been untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered in his actions. He has been consistent in his actions. He has practiced consistently with regard to the precepts. He is a virtuous, principled person, not an unprincipled one.’ “‘It’s through living together that a person’s virtue may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said.
- [2] “‘It’s through dealing with a person that his purity may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not 10 by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was said. And in reference to what was it said?  “There is the case where one individual, through dealing with another, knows this: ‘This person deals one way when one-on-one, another way when with two, another way when with three, another way when with many. His earlier dealings do not jibe with his later dealings. He is impure in his dealings, not pure.’ And then there is the case where one individual, through dealing with another, knows this: ‘The way this person deals when one-on-one, is the same way he deals when with two, when with three, when with many. His earlier dealings jibe with his later dealings. He is pure in his dealings, not impure.’ “‘It’s through dealing with a person that his purity may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said.  
- [3] “‘It’s through adversity that a person’s endurance may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was said. And in reference to what was it said?  “There is the case where a person, suffering loss of relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through disease, does not reflect: ‘That’s how it is when living together in the world. That’s how it is when gaining a personal identity [atta-bhava, literally “self-state”]. When there is living in the world, when there is the gaining of a personal identity, these eight worldly conditions spin after the world, and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions: gain, loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, & pain.’ Suffering loss of relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through disease, he sorrows, grieves, & laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. And then there is the case where a person, suffering loss of relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through disease, reflects: ‘That’s how it is when living together in the world. That’s how it is when gaining a personal identity. When there is living in the world, when there is the gaining of a personal identity, these eight worldly conditions spin after the world, and the world spins after these eight worldly conditions: gain, loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, & pain.’ Suffering loss of relatives, loss of wealth, or loss through disease, he does not sorrow, grieve, or lament, does not beat his breast or become distraught.  “‘It’s through adversity that a person’s endurance may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not 11 discerning’: Thus it was said. And in reference to this was it said.  
- [4] “‘It’s through discussion that a person’s discernment may be known, and then only after a long period, not a short period; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; by one who is discerning, not by one who is not discerning’: Thus it was said. And in reference to what was it said?  “There is the case where one individual, through discussion with another, knows this: ‘From the way this person rises to an issue, from the way he applies [his reasoning], from the way he addresses a question, he is dull, not discerning. Why is that? He does not make statements that are deep, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by the wise.  He cannot declare the meaning, teach it, describe it, set it forth, reveal it, explain it, or make it plain. He is dull, not discerning.’ Just as if a man with good eyesight standing on the shore of a body of water were to see a small fish rise. The thought would occur to him, ‘From the rise of this fish, from the break of its ripples, from its speed, it is a small fish, not a large one.’ In the same way, one individual, in discussion with another, knows this: ‘From the way this person rises to an issue, from the way he applies [his reasoning], from the way he addresses a question… he is dull, not discerning.’

- “And then there is the case where one individual, through discussion with another, knows this: ‘From the way this person rises to an issue, from the way he applies [his reasoning], from the way he addresses a question, he is discerning, not dull.

And in reference to this was it said.” —AN 4:192 In addition to requiring time and clear powers of observation, the ability to recognize a person of integrity requires that you be a person of integrity as well.  12 “Monks, could a person of no integrity know of a person of no integrity: ‘This is a person of no integrity’?” “No, lord.” “Good, monks. It’s impossible, there’s no way, that a person of no integrity would know of a person of no integrity: ‘This is a person of no integrity.’ “Could a person of no integrity know of a person of integrity: ‘This is a person of integrity’?” “No, lord.” “Good, monks. It’s impossible, there’s no way, that a person of no integrity would know of a person of integrity: ‘This is a person of integrity.’”….

“Now, monks, could a person of integrity know of a person of no integrity: ‘This is a person of no integrity’?” “Yes, lord.” “Good, monks. It is possible that a person of integrity would know of a person of no integrity: ‘This is a person of no integrity.’ “Could a person of integrity know of a person of integrity: ‘This is a person of integrity’?”

“Yes, lord.” “Good, monks. It is possible that a person of integrity would know of a person of integrity: ‘This is a person of integrity.’ “A person of integrity is endowed with qualities of integrity; he is a person of integrity in his friendship, in the way he wills, the way he gives advice, the way he speaks, the way he acts, the views he holds, & the way he gives a gift.  “And how is a person of integrity endowed with qualities of integrity? There is the case where a person of integrity is endowed with conviction, conscience, concern; he is learned, with aroused persistence, unmuddled mindfulness, & good discernment. This is how a person of integrity is endowed with qualities of integrity.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in his friendship?  There is the case where a person of integrity has, as his friends & companions, those contemplatives & brahmans who are endowed with conviction, shame, compunction; who are learned, with aroused persistence, unmuddled mindfulness, & good discernment. This is how a person of integrity is a person of integrity in his friendship.  

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the way he wills?  There is the case where a person of integrity wills neither for his own affliction, nor for the affliction of others, nor for the affliction of both. This is how a 13 person of integrity is a person of integrity in the way he wills.  “And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the way he gives advice? There is the case where a person of integrity gives advice neither for his own affliction, nor for the affliction of others, nor for the affliction of both.  This is how a person of integrity is a person of integrity in the way he gives advice.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the way he speaks?  There is the case where a person of integrity is one who refrains from lies, refrains from divisive tale-bearing, refrains from harsh speech, refrains from idle chatter. This is how a person of integrity is a person of integrity in the way he speaks.  

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the way he acts?  There is the case where a person of integrity is one who refrains from taking life, refrains from stealing, refrains from illicit sex. This is how a person of integrity is a person of integrity in the way he acts.  

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the views he holds? There is the case where a person of integrity is one who holds a view like this: ‘There is what is given, what is offered, what is sacrificed. There are fruits & results of good & bad actions. There is this world & the next world.  There is mother & father. There are spontaneously reborn beings; there are contemplatives & brahmans who, faring rightly & practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next after having directly known & realized it for themselves.’ This is how a person of integrity is a person of integrity in the views he holds.

“And how is a person of integrity a person of integrity in the way he gives a gift? There is the case where a person of integrity gives a gift attentively, with his own hand, respectfully, not as if throwing it away, with the view that something will come of it. This is how a person of integrity is a person of integrity in the way he gives a gift.

“This person of integrity—thus endowed with qualities of integrity; a person of integrity in his friendship, in the way he wills, the way he gives advice, the way he speaks, the way he acts, the views he holds, & the way he gives a gift—on the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in the destination of people of integrity. And what is the destination of people of integrity? Greatness among devas or among human beings.”

—MN 110

Regard him as one who points out treasure, 14 the wise one who seeing your faults rebukes you.  Stay with this sort of sage.  For the one who stays with a sage of this sort, things get better, not worse.

—Dhp 76

Listening to the True Dhamma

The opportunity to listen to the Dhamma is considered valuable both because it is rare and because it yields great benefits.  Hard the chance to hear the true Dhamma.

—Dhp 182

“There are these five rewards in listening to the Dhamma. Which five?  “[1] One hears what one has not heard before. [2] One clarifies what one has heard before. [3] One gets rid of doubt. [4] One’s views are made straight.  [5] One’s mind grows calm.  “These are the five rewards in listening to the Dhamma.”

—AN 5:202

To obtain these benefits, one must come to the Dhamma both with the right karmic background and with the right attitude.  “Endowed with these six qualities, a person is capable of alighting on the lawfulness, the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the true Dhamma.

- Which six?
“He is not endowed with a (present) kamma obstruction, a defilement
obstruction, or a result-of-(past)-kamma obstruction; he has conviction, has
the desire (to listen), and is discerning.
“Endowed with these six qualities, a person is capable of alighting on the
lawfulness, the rightness of skillful mental qualities even while listening to the
true Dhamma.”
—AN 6:86
15
“With what virtue,
what behavior,
nurturing what actions,
would a person become rightly based
and attain the ultimate goal?”
“One should be respectful
of one’s superiors
1
& not envious;
should have a sense of the time
for seeing teachers;
2
should value the opportunity
when a talk on Dhamma’s in progress;
should listen intently
to well-spoken words;
should go at the proper time,
humbly, casting off stubbornness,
to one’s teacher’s presence;
should both recollect & follow
the Dhamma, its meaning,
restraint, & the holy life.
Delighting in Dhamma,
savoring Dhamma,
established in Dhamma,
with a sense of how
to investigate Dhamma,
one should not speak in ways
destructive of Dhamma,
3
should guide oneself
with true, well-spoken words.
Shedding
hilarity, chattering,
lamentation, hatred,
deception, deceit,
greed, pride,
confrontation, roughness,
astringency, infatuation,
one should go about free
of intoxication,
steadfast within.
16
Understanding’s the heartwood
of well-spoken words;
concentration, the heartwood
of learning & understanding.
When a person is hasty & heedless
his discernment & learning
don’t grow.
While those who delight
in the doctrines taught by the noble ones,
are unexcelled
in word, action, & mind.
They, established in
calm,
composure, &
concentration,
have reached
what discernment & learning
have as their heartwood.”

—Sn 2:9
NOTES

1. According to the Commentary, one’s superiors include those who have more
wisdom than oneself, more skill in concentration and other aspects of the path than
oneself, and those senior to oneself.
2. The Commentary says that the right time to see a teacher is when one is
overcome with passion, aversion, and delusion, and cannot find a way out on one’s
own. This echoes a passage in AN 6:26, in which Ven. Maha Kaccana says that the
right time to visit a “monk worthy of esteem” is when one needs help in overcoming
any of the five hindrances or when one doesn’t yet have an appropriate theme to focus
on to put an end to the mind’s effluents.
3. The Commentary equates “words destructive of the Dhamma” with “animal
talk.” See the discussion under Pacittiya 85 in The Buddhist Monastic Code.
4. The heartwood of learning & discernment is release.
Ven. Yasadatta:
Intent on quibbling,
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.
He’s as far from the True Dhamma
as the ground is from the sky.
17
Intent on quibbling,
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.
He wanes from the True Dhamma
like the moon in the dark half of the month.
Intent on quibbling,
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.
He dries up in the True Dhamma
like a fish in next to no water.
Intent on quibbling,
the dullard hears the Conqueror’s teaching.
He doesn’t grow in the True Dhamma,
like a rotten seed in a field.
But whoever hears the Conqueror’s teaching
with guarded intent,
doing away with effluents
—all—
realizing the unshakable,
attaining the foremost peace,
is—effluent-free—
totally unbound.
—Thag 5:10
It’s also important to understand clearly the standards for distinguishing
true Dhamma from false. These standards come down to a pragmatic test:
How does one behave, and what results come from one’s behavior, when one
puts the Dhamma into practice?
As they were sitting to one side, the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the
Blessed One, “Venerable sir, there are some contemplatives & brahmans who
come to Kesaputta. They expound & glorify their own doctrines, but as for the
doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them,
& disparage them. And then other contemplatives & brahmans come to
Kesaputta. They expound & glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines
of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &
disparage them. They leave us simply uncertain & doubtful: Which of these
venerable contemplatives & brahmans are speaking the truth, and which ones
are lying?”
18
“Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are doubtful. When
there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don’t
go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by conjecture, by
inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability,
or by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our teacher.’ When you know for
yourselves that, ‘These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy;
these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when undertaken &
carried out, lead to harm & to suffering’—then you should abandon them…
“What do you think, Kalamas: When greed arises in a person, does it arise
for welfare or for harm?”
“For harm, lord.”
“And this greedy person, overcome by greed, his mind possessed by greed:
Doesn’t he kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person’s
wife, tell lies, and induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term
harm & suffering?”
“Yes, lord.”
[Similarly for aversion & delusion.]
“So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful or unskillful?”
“Unskillful, lord.”
“Blameworthy or blameless?”
“Blameworthy, lord.”
“Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?”
“Criticized by the wise, lord.”
“When undertaken & carried out, do they lead to harm & to suffering, or
not?”
“When undertaken & carried out, they lead to harm & to suffering…”
“…Now, Kalamas, don’t go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by
scripture, by conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through
pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our
teacher.’ When you know for yourselves that, ‘These qualities are skillful; these
qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities,
when undertaken & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness’—then you
should enter & remain in them.
“What do you think, Kalamas: When lack of greed arises in a person, does it
arise for welfare or for harm?”
“For welfare, lord.”
19
“And this ungreedy person, not overcome by greed, his mind not possessed
by greed: He doesn’t kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another
person’s wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for longterm welfare & happiness—right?”
“Yes, lord.”
[Similarly for lack of aversion & lack of delusion.]
“So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful or unskillful?”
“Skillful, lord.”
“Blameworthy or blameless?”
“Blameless, lord.”
“Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?”
“Praised by the wise, lord.”
“When undertaken & carried out, do they lead to welfare & to happiness, or
not?”
“When undertaken & carried out, they lead to welfare & to happiness…”
—AN 3:65
“Gotami, the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities lead—
to passion, not to dispassion;
to being fettered, not to being unfettered;
to accumulating, not to shedding;
to self-aggrandizement, not to modesty;
to discontent, not to contentment;
to entanglement, not to seclusion;
to laziness, not to aroused persistence;
to being burdensome, not to being unburdensome’:
You may categorically hold, ‘This is not the Dhamma, this is not the
Vinaya, this is not the Teacher’s instruction.’
“As for the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities lead—
to dispassion, not to passion;
to being unfettered, not to being fettered;
to shedding, not to accumulating;
to modesty, not to self-aggrandizement;
to contentment, not to discontent;
to seclusion, not to entanglement;
to aroused persistence, not to laziness;
20
to being unburdensome, not to being burdensome’:
You may categorically hold, ‘This is the Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is
the Teacher’s instruction.’”
—AN 8:53
“Upali, the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities do not lead
to utter disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct
knowledge, to self-awakening, nor to Unbinding’: You may categorically hold,
‘This is not the Dhamma, this is not the Vinaya, this is not the Teacher’s
instruction.’
“As for the qualities of which you may know, ‘These qualities lead to utter
disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to direct knowledge, to
self-awakening, to Unbinding’: You may categorically hold, ‘This is the
Dhamma, this is the Vinaya, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’”
—AN 7:80
The test for the true Dhamma being pragmatic, this means that even when
you are convinced that you have heard the true Dhamma, you must be careful
to realize that simply hearing the truth is not enough to know it for sure.
The Buddha: “There are five things that can turn out in two ways in the
here-&-now. Which five? Conviction, liking, unbroken tradition, reasoning by
analogy, & an agreement through pondering views. These are the five things
that can turn out in two ways in the here-&-now. Now some things are firmly
held in conviction and yet vain, empty, & false. Some things are not firmly
held in conviction, and yet they are genuine, factual, & unmistaken. Some
things are well-liked… truly an unbroken tradition… well-reasoned… Some
things are well-pondered and yet vain, empty, & false. Some things are not
well-pondered, and yet they are genuine, factual, & unmistaken. In these cases
it isn’t proper for a knowledgeable person who safeguards the truth to come to
a definite conclusion, ‘Only this is true; anything else is worthless.”
Kapadika Bharadvaja: “But to what extent, Master Gotama, is there the
safeguarding of the truth? To what extent does one safeguard the truth? We ask
Master Gotama about the safeguarding of the truth.”
The Buddha: “If a person has conviction, his statement, ‘This is my
conviction,’ safeguards the truth. But he doesn’t yet come to the definite
conclusion that ‘Only this is true; anything else is worthless.’ To this extent,
Bharadvaja, there is the safeguarding of the truth. To this extent one safeguards
the truth. I describe this as the safeguarding of the truth. But it is not yet an
21
awakening to the truth.”
—MN 95
Appropriate Attention
Having heard the Dhamma, it is important to bring appropriate attention
—seeing things in terms of cause and effect—both to what you have heard and
to your experiences in general, for this one factor can make all the difference in
the success or failure of your practice.
“With regard to internal factors, I don’t envision any other single factor like
appropriate attention as doing so much for a monk in training, who has not
attained the goal but remains intent on the unsurpassed safety from bondage.
A monk who attends appropriately abandons what is unskillful and develops
what is skillful.
Appropriate attention
as a quality
of a monk in training:
nothing else
does so much
for attaining the superlative goal.
A monk, striving appropriately,
attains the ending of stress.
—Iti 16
I have heard that on one occasion a certain monk was dwelling among the
Kosalans in a forest thicket. Now at that time, he spent the day’s abiding
thinking evil, unskillful thoughts: i.e., thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill
will, thoughts of harmfulness.
Then the devata inhabiting the forest thicket, feeling sympathy for the
monk, desiring his benefit, desiring to bring him to his senses, approached
him and addressed him with this verse:
“From inappropriate attention
you’re being chewed by your thoughts.
Relinquishing what’s inappropriate,
contemplate
appropriately.
Keeping your mind on the Teacher,
22
the Dhamma, the Sangha, your virtues,
you will arrive at
joy,
rapture,
pleasure
without doubt.
Then, saturated
with joy,
you will put an end
to suffering & stress.”
The monk, chastened by the devata, came to his senses.
—SN 9:11
Appropriate attention is essentially the ability to frame your understanding
of experience in the right terms. In many cases, this means framing the right
questions for gaining insight into suffering and its end.
“This is the way leading to discernment: when visiting a contemplative or
brahman, to ask: ‘What is skillful, venerable sir? What is unskillful? What is
blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not
be cultivated? What, having been done by me, will be for my long-term harm
& suffering? Or what, having been done by me, will be for my long-term
welfare & happiness?’”
—MN 135
“There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person…does not
discern what ideas are fit for attention, or what ideas are unfit for attention.
This being so, he does not attend to ideas fit for attention, and attends
[instead] to ideas unfit for attention. And what are the ideas unfit for attention
that he attends to? Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the
unarisen effluent of sensuality arises, and the arisen effluent of sensuality
increases; the unarisen effluent of becoming… the unarisen effluent of
ignorance arises, and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases…. This is how
he attends inappropriately: ‘Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was
I in the past? How was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past?
Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the
future? How shall I be in the future? Having been what, what shall I be in the
future?’ Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present: ‘Am I?
Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it
bound?’
23
“As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in
him: The view I have a self arises in him as true & established, or the view I have
no self… or the view It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self… or the view
It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self… or the view It is precisely by
means of not-self that I perceive self arises in him as true & established, or else he
has a view like this: This very self of mine—the knower that is sensitive here & there
to the ripening of good & bad actions—is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting,
eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity. This is called a
thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of
views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-themill person is not freed from birth, aging, & death, from sorrow, lamentation,
pain, distress, & despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from stress.
“The well-instructed noble disciple… discerns what ideas are fit for
attention, and what ideas are unfit for attention. This being so, he does not
attend to ideas unfit for attention, and attends [instead] to ideas fit for
attention…. And what are the ideas fit for attention that he attends to?
Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of
sensuality does not arise, and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned;
the unarisen effluent of becoming… the unarisen effluent of ignorance does
not arise, and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned…. He attends
appropriately, This is stress… This is the origination of stress… This is the cessation
of stress… This is the way leading to the cessation of stress. As he attends
appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: identity-view,
doubt, and grasping at habits & practices. These are called the effluents that are
to be abandoned by seeing.”
—MN 2
Appropriate attention can also mean framing the way you understand
events as they occur.
Ven. MahaKotthita: “Sariputta my friend, which things should a virtuous
monk attend to in an appropriate way?”
Ven. Sariputta: “A virtuous monk, Kotthita my friend, should attend in an
appropriate way to the five clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a
disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an
emptiness, not-self. Which five? The form clinging-aggregate, the feeling…
perception… fabrications… consciousness clinging-aggregate. A virtuous monk
should attend in an appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as
inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien,
a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a virtuous monk,
24
attending in an appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as
inconstant… not-self, would realize the fruit of stream-entry.”
Ven. MahaKotthita: “Then which things should a monk who has attained
stream-entry attend to in an appropriate way?”
Ven. Sariputta: “A monk who has attained stream-entry should attend in an
appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a
disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an
emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has attained streamentry, attending in an appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as
inconstant… not-self, would realize the fruit of once-returning.”
Ven. MahaKotthita: “Then which things should a monk who has attained
once-returning attend to in an appropriate way?”
Ven. Sariputta: “A monk who has attained once-returning should attend in
an appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a
disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an
emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has attained oncereturning, attending in an appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as
inconstant… not-self, would realize the fruit of non-returning.”
Ven. MahaKotthita: “Then which things should a monk who has attained
non-returning attend to in an appropriate way?”
Ven. Sariputta: “A monk who has attained non-returning should attend in
an appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a
disease, a cancer, an arrow, painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an
emptiness, not-self. For it is possible that a monk who has attained nonreturning, attending in an appropriate way to these five clinging-aggregates as
inconstant… not-self, would realize the fruit of arahantship.”
Ven. MahaKotthita: “Then which things should an arahant attend to in an
appropriate way?”
Ven. Sariputta: “An arahant should attend in an appropriate way to these
five clinging-aggregates as inconstant, stressful, a disease, a cancer, an arrow,
painful, an affliction, alien, a dissolution, an emptiness, not-self. Although, for
an arahant, there is nothing further to do, and nothing to add to what has
been done, still these things—when developed & pursued—lead both to a
pleasant abiding in the here-&-now and to mindfulness & alertness.”
—SN 22:122
Practice in Accordance with the Dhamma
25
In developing dispassion for the clinging-aggregates, appropriate attention is
an important first step in practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the
Dhamma.
“For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, this
is what accords with the Dhamma: that he keep cultivating disenchantment
with regard to form, that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to
feeling, that he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to perception, that
he keep cultivating disenchantment with regard to fabrications, that he keep
cultivating disenchantment with regard to consciousness. As he keeps
cultivating disenchantment with regard to form… feeling… perception…
fabrications… consciousness, he comprehends form… feeling… perception…
fabrications… consciousness. As he comprehends form… feeling…
perception… fabrications… consciousness, he is totally released from form…
feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness. He is totally released
from sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, & despairs. He is totally released,
I tell you, from suffering & stress.”
“For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, this
is what accords with the Dhamma: that he keep focused on inconstancy…
stress… not-self with regard to form, that he keep focused on inconstancy…
stress… not-self with regard to feeling… perception… fabrications…
consciousness. As he keeps focusing on inconstancy… stress… not-self with
regard to form… feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness, he
comprehends form… feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness. As
he comprehends form… feeling… perception… fabrications… consciousness,
he is totally released from form… feeling… perception… fabrications…
consciousness. He is totally released from sorrows, lamentations, pains,
distresses, & despairs. He is totally released, I tell you, from suffering & stress.”
—SN 22:39-42
“If a monk teaches the Dhamma for the sake of disenchantment,
dispassion, & cessation with regard to aging & death… birth… becoming…
clinging/sustenance… craving… feeling… contact… the six sense media…
name & form… consciousness… fabrications… ignorance, he deserves to be
called a monk who is a speaker of Dhamma. If he practices for the sake of
disenchantment, dispassion, & cessation with regard to aging & death…
ignorance, he deserves to be called a monk who practices the Dhamma in
accordance with the Dhamma. If—through disenchantment, dispassion,
cessation, and lack of clinging/sustenance with regard to aging & death…
ignorance—he is released, then he deserves to be called a monk who has
26
attained Unbinding in the here-&-now.”
—SN 22:67
The practice leading to disenchantment, dispassion, and release follows a
stepwise path of cause and effect.
“Now, I tell you, clear knowing & release have their nutriment. They are not
without nutriment. And what is their nutriment? The seven factors for
awakening…. And what is the nutriment for the seven factors for awakening?
The four establishings of mindfulness…. And what is the nutriment for the
four establishings of mindfulness? The three forms of right conduct…. And
what is the nutriment for the three forms of right conduct? Restraint of the
senses…. And what is the nutriment for restraint of the senses? Mindfulness &
alertness…. And what is the nutriment for mindfulness & alertness?
Appropriate attention…. And what is the nutriment for appropriate attention?
Conviction…. And what is the nutriment for conviction? Hearing the true
Dhamma…. And what is the nutriment for hearing the true Dhamma?
Associating with people who are truly good….
“Just as when the gods pour rain in heavy drops & crash thunder on the
upper mountains: The water, flowing down along the slopes, fills the
mountain clefts & rifts & gullies… the little ponds… the big lakes… the little
rivers… the big rivers. When the big rivers are full, they fill the great ocean, and
thus is the great ocean fed, thus is it filled. In the same way, when associating
with truly good people is brought to fulfillment, it fulfills [the conditions for]
hearing the true Dhamma… conviction… appropriate attention… mindfulness
& alertness… restraint of the senses… the three forms of right conduct… the
four establishings of mindfulness… the seven factors for awakening. When the
seven factors for awakening are brought to fulfillment, they fulfill [the
conditions for] clear knowing & release. Thus is clear knowing & release fed,
thus is it brought to fulfillment.”
—AN 10:61
Mindfulness & Alertness
“Stay mindful, monks, and alert. This is our instruction to you all. And how
is a monk mindful? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the
body in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed & distress
with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings… mind… mental
qualities in & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed &
distress with reference to the world. This is how a monk is mindful.
27
“And how is a monk alert? There is the case where feelings are known to the
monk as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside. Thoughts
are known to him as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside.
Discernment [vl: perception] is known to him as it arises, known as it persists,
known as it subsides. This is how a monk is alert. So stay mindful, monks, and
alert. This is our instruction to you all.”
—SN 47:35
Restraint of the Senses
“And how does a monk guard the doors of his senses? On seeing a form
with the eye, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which—if he were to
dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye—evil, unskillful qualities
such as greed or distress might assail him. On hearing a sound with the ear….
On smelling an odor with the nose…. One tasting a flavor with the tongue….
On touching a tactile sensation with the body…. On cognizing an idea with
the intellect, he does not grasp at any theme or details by which—if he were to
dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect—evil, unskillful
qualities such as greed or distress might assail him. Endowed with this noble
restraint over the sense faculties, he is inwardly sensitive to the pleasure of
being blameless. This is how a monk guards the doors of his senses.”
—DN 2
The Three Forms of Right Conduct
“Now, Cunda, there are three ways in which one is made pure by bodily
action, four ways in which one is made pure by verbal action, and three ways
in which one is made pure by mental action.
“And how is one made pure in three ways by bodily action? There is the
case where a certain person, abandoning the taking of life, abstains from the
taking of life. He dwells with his rod laid down, his knife laid down,
scrupulous, merciful, compassionate for the welfare of all living beings.
Abandoning the taking of what is not given, he abstains from taking what is
not given. He does not take, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a
wilderness that belong to others and have not been given by them.
Abandoning sensual misconduct, he abstains from sensual misconduct. He
does not get sexually involved with those who are protected by their mothers,
their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or their Dhamma;
those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those crowned
with flowers by another man. This is how one is made pure in three ways by
28
bodily action.
“And how is one made pure in four ways by verbal action? There is the case
where a certain person, abandoning false speech, abstains from false speech.
When he has been called to a town meeting, a group meeting, a gathering of
his relatives, his guild, or of the royalty, if he is asked as a witness, ‘Come &
tell, good man, what you know’: If he doesn’t know, he says, ‘I don’t know.’ If
he does know, he says, ‘I know.’ If he hasn’t seen, he says, ‘I haven’t seen.’ If he
has seen, he says, ’I have seen.’ Thus he doesn’t consciously tell a lie for his
own sake, for the sake of another, or for the sake of any reward. Abandoning
false speech, he abstains from false speech. He speaks the truth, holds to the
truth, is firm, reliable, no deceiver of the world. Abandoning divisive speech,
he abstains from divisive speech. What he has heard here he doesn’t tell there
to break those people apart from these people here. What he has heard there
he doesn’t tell here to break these people apart from those people there. Thus
reconciling those who have broken apart or cementing those who are united,
he loves concord, delights in concord, enjoys concord, speaks things that create
concord. Abandoning abusive speech, he abstains from abusive speech. He
speaks words that are soothing to the ear, that are affectionate, that go to the
heart, that are polite, appealing & pleasing to people at large. Abandoning idle
chatter, he abstains from idle chatter. He speaks in season, speaks what is
factual, what is in accordance with the goal, the Dhamma, & the Vinaya. He
speaks words worth treasuring, seasonable, reasonable, circumscribed,
connected with the goal. This is how one is made pure in four ways by verbal
action.
“And how is one made pure in three ways by mental action? There is the
case where a certain person is not covetous. He does not covet the belongings
of others, thinking, ‘O, that what belongs to others would be mine!’ He bears
no ill will and is not corrupt in the resolves of his heart. [He thinks,] ‘May
these beings be free from animosity, free from oppression, free from trouble,
and may they look after themselves with ease!’ He has right view and is not
warped in the way he sees things: ‘There is what is given, what is offered, what
is sacrificed. There are fruits & results of good & bad actions. There is this
world & the next world. There is mother & father. There are spontaneously
reborn beings; there are contemplatives & brahmans who, faring rightly &
practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next after having directly known &
realized it for themselves.’ This is how one is made pure in three ways by
mental action.
“These, Cunda, are the ten courses of skillful action.”
—AN 10:176

The Four Establishings of Mindfulness
“[1] Now, on whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns that he
is breathing in long; or breathing out long, discerns that he is breathing out
long; or breathing in short, discerns that he is breathing in short; or breathing
out short, discerns that he is breathing out short; trains himself to breathe in…
&… out sensitive to the entire body; trains himself to breathe in…&…out
calming bodily fabrication: On that occasion the monk remains focused on the
body in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with
reference to the world. I tell you, monks, that this—the in-&-out breath—is
classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion
remains focused on the body in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting
aside greed & distress with reference to the world.
“[2] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in…&…out
sensitive to rapture; trains himself to breathe in…&…out sensitive to pleasure;
trains himself to breathe in…&…out sensitive to mental fabrication; trains
himself to breathe in…&…out calming mental fabrication: On that occasion
the monk remains focused on feelings in & of themselves—ardent, alert, &
mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world. I tell you,
monks, that this—close attention to in-&-out breaths—is classed as a feeling
among feelings, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on
feelings in & of themselves—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed &
distress with reference to the world.
“[3] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in…&…out
sensitive to the mind; trains himself to breathe in…&…out satisfying the
mind; trains himself to breathe in…&…out steadying the mind; trains himself
to breathe in…&…out releasing the mind: On that occasion the monk remains
focused on the mind in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—subduing greed &
distress with reference to the world. I don’t say that there is mindfulness of in-
&-out breathing in one of confused mindfulness and no alertness, which is
why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in & of itself—
ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed & distress with reference to the
world.
“[4] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself to breathe in…&…out
focusing on inconstancy; trains himself to breathe in…&…out focusing on
dispassion; trains himself to breathe in…&…out focusing on cessation; trains
himself to breathe in…&…out focusing on relinquishment: On that occasion
the monk remains focused on mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent,
alert, & mindful—subduing greed & distress with reference to the world. He
who sees clearly with discernment the abandoning of greed & distress is one
30
who oversees with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion
remains focused on mental qualities in & of themselves—ardent, alert, &
mindful—putting aside greed & distress with reference to the world.
“This is how mindfulness of in-&-out breathing is developed & pursued so
as to bring the four establishings of mindfulness to their culmination.
The Seven Factors for Awakening
“And how are the four establishings of mindfulness developed & pursued
so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination?
“[1] On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the body in & of
itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed & distress with reference
to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady & without lapse. When
his mindfulness is steady & without lapse, then mindfulness as a factor for
awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the
culmination of its development.
“[2] Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, & comes to a
comprehension of that quality with discernment. When he remains mindful in
this way, examining, analyzing, & coming to a comprehension of that quality
with discernment, then analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening becomes
aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its
development.
“[3] In one who examines, analyzes, & comes to a comprehension of that
quality with discernment, unflagging persistence is aroused. When unflagging
persistence is aroused in one who examines, analyzes, & comes to a
comprehension of that quality with discernment, then persistence as a factor for
awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the
culmination of its development.
“[4] In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises.
When a rapture not-of-the-flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused,
then rapture as a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for
him it goes to the culmination of its development.
“[5] For one who is enraptured, the body grows calm and the mind grows
calm. When the body & mind of an enraptured monk grow calm, then calm as
a factor for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to
the culmination of its development.
“[6] For one who is at ease—his body calmed—the mind becomes
concentrated. When the mind of one who is at ease—his body calmed—
becomes concentrated, then concentration as a factor for awakening becomes
31
aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its
development.
“[7] He oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity. When he
oversees the mind thus concentrated with equanimity, equanimity as a factor
for awakening becomes aroused. He develops it, and for him it goes to the
culmination of its development.
[Similarly with the other three establishings of mindfulness: feelings, mind,
& mental qualities.]
“This is how the four establishings of mindfulness are developed & pursued
so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination.
Clear Knowing & Release
“And how are the seven factors for awakening developed & pursued so as to
bring clear knowing & release to their culmination? There is the case where a
monk develops mindfulness as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion…
dispassion… cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He develops analysis of
qualities as a factor for awakening… persistence as a factor for awakening…
rapture as a factor for awakening… calm as a factor for awakening…
concentration as a factor for awakening… equanimity as a factor for awakening
dependent on seclusion… dispassion… cessation, resulting in relinquishment.
“This is how the seven factors for awakening, when developed & pursued,
bring clear knowing & release to their culmination.”
—MN 118
The ability to follow this path to completion is not just a matter of mastering
technique. It also depends on the ability to develop strong character traits.
“Now, what are the eight thoughts of a great person? This Dhamma is for
one who is modest, not for one who is self-aggrandizing. This Dhamma is for
one who is content, not for one who is discontent. This Dhamma is for one
who is reclusive, not for one who is entangled. This Dhamma is for one whose
persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy. This Dhamma is for one whose
mindfulness is established, not for one whose mindfulness is confused. This
Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated, not for one whose mind is
unconcentrated. This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for
one whose discernment is weak. This Dhamma is for one who enjoys nonobjectification, who delights in non-objectification, not for one who enjoys &
delights in objectification.
32
“‘This Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is selfaggrandizing.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the
case where a monk, being modest, does not want it to be known that ‘He is
modest.’ Being content, he does not want it to be known that ‘He is content.’
Being reclusive, he does not want it to be known that ‘He is reclusive.’ His
persistence being aroused, he does not want it to be known that ‘His
persistence is aroused.’ His mindfulness being established, he does not want it
to be known that ‘His mindfulness is established.’ His mind being
concentrated, he does not want it to be known that ‘His mind is concentrated.’
Being endowed with discernment, he does not want it to be known that ‘He is
endowed with discernment.’ Enjoying non-objectification, he does not want it
to be known that ‘He is enjoying non-objectification.’ ‘This Dhamma is for one
who is modest, not for one who is self-aggrandizing.’ Thus was it said. And
with reference to this was it said.
“‘This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.’
Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a
monk is content with any old robe cloth at all, any old almsfood, any old
lodging, any old medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all. ‘This Dhamma
is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.’ Thus was it said. And
with reference to this was it said.
“‘This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive, not for one who is entangled.’
Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a
monk, when living in seclusion, is visited by monks, nuns, lay men, lay
women, kings, royal ministers, sectarians & their disciples. With his mind bent
on seclusion, tending toward seclusion, inclined toward seclusion, aiming at
seclusion, relishing renunciation, he converses with them only as much as
necessary for them to take their leave. ‘This Dhamma is for one who is
reclusive, not for one in entanglement.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to
this was it said.
“‘This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one who is
lazy.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case
where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental
qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities. He is steadfast, solid in his
effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities. ‘This
Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy.’
Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.
“‘This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established, not for one
whose mindfulness is confused.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it
said? There is the case where a monk is mindful, highly meticulous,
33
remembering & able to call to mind even things that were done & said long
ago. ‘This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established, not for one
whose mindfulness is confused.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to this
was it said.
“‘This Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated, not for one whose
mind is unconcentrated.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said?
There is the case where a monk—quite secluded from sensuality, secluded
from unskillful qualities—enters & remains in the first jhana: rapture &
pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought & evaluation.
With the stilling of directed thoughts & evaluations, he enters & remains in the
second jhana: rapture & pleasure born of concentration, unification of
awareness free from directed thought & evaluation—internal assurance. With
the fading of rapture he remains equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses
pleasure with the body. He enters & remains in

- the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, ‘Equanimous & mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.’ With the abandoning of pleasure & pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—he enters & remains in the
- fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. ‘This Dhamma is for one
whose mind is concentrated, not for one whose mind is unconcentrated.’ Thus
was it said. And with reference to this was it said.
“‘This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for one whose
discernment is weak.’ Thus was it said. With reference to what was it said?
There is the case where a monk is discerning, endowed with discernment of
arising & passing away—noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of
stress. ‘This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for one whose
discernment is weak.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.
“‘This Dhamma is for one who enjoys non-objectification, who delights in
non-objectification, not for one who enjoys & delights in objectification.’ Thus
was it said. With reference to what was it said? There is the case where a
monk’s mind leaps up, grows confident, steadfast, & firm in the cessation of
objectification. ‘This Dhamma is for one who enjoys non-objectification, who
delights in non-objectification, not for one who enjoys & delights in
objectification.’ Thus was it said. And with reference to this was it said.”
—AN 8:30
“A monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of
hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, an unexcelled field of merit
for the world. Which seven? There is the case where a monk is one with a sense
of Dhamma, a sense of meaning, a sense of himself, a sense of moderation, a
sense of time, a sense of social gatherings, & a sense of distinctions among
34
individuals.
“And how is a monk one with a sense of Dhamma? There is the case where
a monk knows the Dhamma: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose & verse,
explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories,
amazing events, question & answer sessions [this is a list of the earliest
classifications of the Buddha’s teachings]. If he didn’t know the Dhamma—
dialogues, narratives of mixed prose & verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous
exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question & answer
sessions—he wouldn’t be said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. So it’s
because he does know the Dhamma—dialogues… question & answer sessions
—that he is said to be one with a sense of Dhamma. This is one with a sense of
Dhamma.
“And how is a monk one with a sense of meaning? There is the case where a
monk knows the meaning of this & that statement—‘This is the meaning of
that statement; that is the meaning of this.’ If he didn’t know the meaning of
this & that statement—‘This is the meaning of that statement; that is the
meaning of this’—he wouldn’t be said to be one with a sense of meaning. So
it’s because he does know the meaning of this & that statement—‘This is the
meaning of that statement; that is the meaning of this’—that he is said to be
one with a sense of meaning. This is one with a sense of Dhamma & a sense of
meaning.
“And how is a monk one with a sense of himself? There is the case where a
monk knows himself: ‘This is how far I have come in conviction, virtue,
learning, generosity, discernment, quick-wittedness.’ If he didn’t know himself
—‘This is how far I have come in conviction, virtue, learning, generosity,
discernment, quick-wittedness’—he wouldn’t be said to be one with a sense of
himself. So it’s because he does know himself—‘This is how far I have come in
conviction, virtue, learning, generosity, discernment, quick-wittedness’—that
he is said to be one with a sense of himself. This is one with a sense of
Dhamma, a sense of meaning, & a sense of himself.
“And how is a monk one with a sense of moderation? There is the case
where a monk knows moderation in accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, &
medicinal requisites for curing the sick. If he didn’t know moderation in
accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, & medicinal requisites for curing the sick,
he wouldn’t be said to be one with a sense of moderation. So it’s because he
does know moderation in accepting robes, almsfood, lodgings, & medicinal
requisites for curing the sick, that he is said to be one with a sense of
moderation. This is one with a sense of Dhamma, a sense of meaning, a sense
of himself, & a sense of moderation.
35
“And how is a monk one with a sense of time? There is the case where a
monk knows the time: ‘This is the time for recitation; this, the time for
questioning; this, the time for making an effort [in meditation]; this, the time
for seclusion.’ If he didn’t know the time—‘This is the time for recitation; this,
the time for questioning; this, the time for making an effort; this, the time for
seclusion’—he wouldn’t be said to be one with a sense of time. So it’s because
he does know the time—‘This is the time for recitation; this, the time for
questioning; this, the time for making an effort; this, the time for seclusion’—
that he is said to be one with a sense of time. This is one with a sense of
Dhamma, a sense of meaning, a sense of himself, a sense of moderation, & a
sense of time.
“And how is a monk one with a sense of social gatherings? There is the case
where a monk knows his social gathering: ‘This is a social gathering of noble
warriors; this, a social gathering of brahmans; this, a social gathering of
householders; this, a social gathering of contemplatives; here one should
approach them in this way, stand in this way, act in this way, sit in this way,
speak in this way, stay silent in this way.’ If he didn’t know his social gathering
—‘This is a social gathering of noble warriors; this, a social gathering of
brahmans; this, a social gathering of householders; this, a social gathering of
contemplatives; here one should approach them in this way, stand in this way,
act in this way, sit in this way, speak in this way, stay silent in this way’—he
wouldn’t be said to be one with a sense of social gatherings. So it’s because he
does know his social gathering—‘This is a social gathering of noble warriors;
this, a social gathering of brahmans; this, a social gathering of householders;
this, a social gathering of contemplatives; here one should approach them in
this way, stand in this way, act in this way, sit in this way, speak in this way,
stay silent in this way’—that he is said to be one with a sense of social
gatherings. This is one with a sense of Dhamma, a sense of meaning, a sense of
himself, a sense of moderation, a sense of time, & a sense of social gatherings.
“And how is a monk one with a sense of distinctions among individuals?
There is the case where people are known to a monk in terms of two
categories.
“Of two people—one who wants to see noble ones and one who doesn’t—
the one who doesn’t want to see noble ones is to be criticized for that reason,
the one who does want to see noble ones is, for that reason, to be praised.
“Of two people who want to see noble ones—one who wants to hear the
true Dhamma and one who doesn’t—the one who doesn’t want to hear the
true Dhamma is to be criticized for that reason, the one who does want to hear
the true Dhamma is, for that reason, to be praised.
36
“Of two people who want to hear the true Dhamma—one who listens with
an attentive ear and one who listens without an attentive ear—the one who
listens without an attentive ear is to be criticized for that reason, the one who
listens with an attentive ear is, for that reason, to be praised.
“Of two people who listen with an attentive ear—one who, having listened
to the Dhamma, remembers it, and one who doesn’t—the one who, having
listened to the Dhamma, doesn’t remember it is to be criticized for that reason,
the one who, having listened to the Dhamma, does remember the Dhamma is,
for that reason, to be praised.
“Of two people who, having listened to the Dhamma, remember it—one
who explores the meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered and one who
doesn’t—the one who doesn’t explore the meaning of the Dhamma he has
remembered is to be criticized for that reason, the one who does explore the
meaning of the Dhamma he has remembered is, for that reason, to be praised.
“Of two people who explore the meaning of the Dhamma they have
remembered—one who practices the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma,
having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning, and one who doesn’t
—the one who doesn’t practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma, having
a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning, is to be criticized for that
reason, the one who does practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma,
having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning is, for that reason, to be
praised.
“Of two people who practice the Dhamma in line with the Dhamma,
having a sense of Dhamma, having a sense of meaning—one who practices for
both his own benefit and that of others, and one who practices for his own
benefit but not that of others—the one who practices for his own benefit but
not that of others is to be criticized for that reason, the one who practices for
both his own benefit and that of others is, for that reason, to be praised.
“This is how people are known to a monk in terms of two categories. And
this is how a monk is one with a sense of distinctions among individuals.
“A monk endowed with these seven qualities is worthy of gifts, worthy of
hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, an unexcelled field of merit
for the world.”
—AN 7:64
To practice the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma not only makes
one worthy of respect, it also is a way of showing respect and gratitude to the
Buddha for his admirable friendship in creating the opportunity for hearing the
true Dhamma.
37
Then the Blessed One [on his death-bed] said to Ven. Ananda, “Ananda, the
twin sal-trees are in full bloom, even though it’s not the flowering season. They
shower, strew, & sprinkle on the Tathagata’s body in homage to him. Heavenly
coral-tree blossoms are falling from the sky…. Heavenly sandalwood powder is
falling from the sky…. Heavenly music is playing in the sky…. Heavenly songs
are sung in the sky, in homage to the Tathagata. But it is not to this extent that
a Tathagata is worshipped, honored, respected, venerated, or paid homage to.
Rather, the monk, nun, male lay follower, or female lay follower who keeps
practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, who keeps
practicing masterfully, who lives in accordance with the Dhamma: that is the
person who worships, honors, respects, venerates, & pays homage to the
Tathagata with the highest homage. So you should train yourselves: ‘We will
keep practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, we will keep
practicing masterfully, we will live in accordance with the Dhamma.’ That’s
how you should train yourselves.”
—DN 16

## P A R T T W O

STREAM ENTRY & ITS RESULTS
When treating the experience of stream entry and its results, the Canon uses
all three of its typical modes of discourse: the narrative mode—stories about
people who have attained stream entry; the cosmological mode—descriptions of
the after-death destinations awaiting those who have attained stream entry;
and what might be called the “emptiness” mode, which describes mental states
in and of themselves as they are directly experienced as absent or present, both
during and after stream entry.
The material in this part of the study guide is presented in five sections. The
first section, The Arising of the Dhamma Eye, discusses the experience of
stream entry, and concludes with a passage indicating why the experience is
described in terms of the faculty of vision. The second section, The Three
Fetters, discusses the three fetters of renewed existence that are cut with the
arising of the Dhamma eye: self-identity views, uncertainty, and grasping at
habits and practices. The third section, The Character of the Stream-enterer,
discusses the personal characteristics of a stream-enterer that flow directly from
the cutting of the first three fetters. This section focuses on three lists of the four
factors of stream entry, which are not to be confused with the four factors for
stream entry discussed in the first part of this study guide. The fourth section,
Rewards, discusses the rewards of stream entry that are come both in this life
and in future lives. The final section, Advice, echoes the Buddha’s last words to
his disciples before entering total nibbana. The discourse reporting those words
—DN 16—also reports that the most backward of the monks present at the
Buddha’s passing away were stream-enterers. The fact that his last words to
them stressed the need for heedfulness underlies the fact that even streamenterers have to be wary of heedlessness. This is especially true in the present
day, when many different meditation schools define the attainment of stream
entry in such different terms, raising the question of whose certification of
stream entry is valid and whose is not. The safest course of action for all
meditators—whether certified as stream-enterers or not, and whether that
certification is valid or not—is to maintain an attitude of heedfulness with
regard to all mental qualities.
* * *
The term “stream” in “stream entry” refers to the point where all eight
factors of the noble eightfold path come together.
39
“Sariputta, ‘The stream, the stream’: thus it is said. And what, Sariputta, is
the stream?”
“This noble eightfold path, lord, is the stream: right view, right resolve,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right
concentration.”
“Very good, Sariputta! Very good! This noble eightfold path—right view,
right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, right concentration—is the stream.”
—SN 55:5
“And what is right view? Knowledge in terms of stress, knowledge in terms
of the origination of stress, knowledge in terms of the cessation of stress,
knowledge in terms of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress:
This is called right view.
“And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on non-ill will,
on harmlessness: This is called right resolve.
“And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, from divisive speech,
from abusive speech, & from idle chatter: This is called right speech.
“And what is right action? Abstaining from taking life, from stealing, &
from sexual intercourse: This is called right action.
“And what is right livelihood? There is the case where a disciple of the
noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with
right livelihood. This is called right livelihood.
“And what is right effort? There is the case where a monk generates desire,
endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds & exerts his intent for the sake of the
non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen… for the sake of
the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen… for the sake of
the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen… (and) for the
maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, & culmination
of skillful qualities that have arisen. This is called right effort.
“And what is right mindfulness? There is the case where a monk remains
focused on the body in & of itself—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside
greed & distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in
& of themselves… the mind in & of itself… mental qualities in & of themselves
—ardent, alert, & mindful—putting aside greed & distress with reference to the
world. This is called right mindfulness.
“And what is right concentration? There is the case where a monk—quite
secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities—enters & remains
40
in the first jhana: rapture & pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by
directed thought & evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts &
evaluations, he enters & remains in the second jhana: rapture & pleasure born
of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &
evaluation—internal assurance. With the fading of rapture he remains
equanimous, mindful, & alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &
remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, ‘Equanimous &
mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.’ With the abandoning of pleasure & pain—
as with the earlier disappearance of elation & distress—he enters & remains in
the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity & mindfulness, neither pleasure nor
pain. This is called right concentration.”
—SN 45:8
The coming-together of these factors is called the stream because it leads
inevitably to two things, just as the current of a tributary will lead inevitably to
a major river and then to the sea. In the immediate present, the stream leads
directly to the arising of the Dhamma eye, the vision that actually constitutes
this first awakening. Over time, the stream ensures that—in no more than
seven lifetimes—one will be totally unbound.
The Arising of the Dhamma Eye
What does the Dhamma eye see when it arises?
Then Ven. Assaji gave this Dhamma exposition to Sariputta the wanderer:
“Whatever phenomena arise from a cause:
Their cause
& their cessation.
Such is the teaching of the Tathagata,
the Great Contemplative.”
Then to Sariputta the wanderer, as he heard this exposition of Dhamma,
there arose the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: Whatever is subject to origination
is all subject to cessation.
—Mv I.23.5
This standard formula—it is repeated throughout the Canon—may not
seem that remarkable an insight. However, the texts make clear that this
41
insight is not a matter of belief or contemplation, but of direct seeing. As the
following passages show, belief and contemplation may be conducive to the
seeing—and an undefined level of belief and discernment may actually
guarantee that someday in this lifetime the seeing will occur—but only with
the actual seeing does there come a dramatic shift in the course of one’s life
and one’s relationship to the Dhamma.
“Monks, the eye is inconstant, changeable, alterable. The ear… The nose…
The tongue… The body… The mind is inconstant, changeable, alterable.
Forms…. Sounds .… Aromas…. Flavors…. Tactile sensations…. Ideas are
inconstant, changeable, alterable.
“Eye-consciousness…. Ear-consciousness…. Nose-consciousness…. Tongueconsciousness…. Body-consciousness…. Intellect-consciousness is inconstant,
changeable, alterable.
“Eye-contact….Ear-contact….Nose-contact….Tongue-contact….Bodycontact…. Intellect-contact is inconstant, changeable, alterable.
“Feeling born of eye-contact…. Feeling born of ear-contact…. Feeling born
of nose-contact…. Feeling born of tongue-contact…. Feeling born of bodycontact…. Feeling born of intellect-contact is inconstant, changeable, alterable.
“Perception of forms…. Perception of sounds…. Perception of smells….
Perception of tastes…. Perception of tactile sensations….Perception of ideas is
inconstant, changeable, alterable.
“Intention for forms…. Intention for sounds…. Intention for smells….
Intention for tastes…. Intention for tactile sensations…. Intention for ideas is
inconstant, changeable, alterable.
“Craving for forms…. Craving for sounds…. Craving for smells…. Craving
for tastes…. Craving for tactile sensations…. Craving for ideas is inconstant,
changeable, alterable.
“The earth property…. The liquid property…. The fire property…. The wind
property… The space property… The consciousness property is inconstant,
changeable, alterable.
“Form…. Feeling…. Perception…. Fabrications…. Consciousness is
inconstant, changeable, alterable.
“One who has conviction & belief that these phenomena are this way is
called a faith-follower: one who has entered the orderliness of rightness,
entered the plane of people of integrity, transcended the plane of the run-ofthe-mill. He is incapable of doing any deed by which he might be reborn in
hell, in the animal womb, or in the realm of hungry ghosts. He is incapable of
42
passing away until he has realized the fruit of stream entry.
“One who, after pondering with a modicum of discernment, has accepted
that these phenomena are this way is called a Dhamma-follower: one who has
entered the orderliness of rightness, entered the plane of people of integrity,
transcended the plane of the run-of-the-mill. He is incapable of doing any
deed by which he might be reborn in hell, in the animal womb, or in the
realm of hungry ghosts. He is incapable of passing away until he has realized
the fruit of stream entry.
“One who knows and sees that these phenomena are this way is called a
stream-enterer, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed for
self-awakening.”
—SN 25:1-10
To Upali the householder, as he was sitting right there, there arose the
dustless, stainless Dhamma eye: Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to
cessation. Then—having seen the Dhamma, having reached the Dhamma,
known the Dhamma, gained a footing in the Dhamma, having crossed over &
beyond doubt, having had no more questioning—Upali the householder
gained fearlessness and was independent of others with regard to the Teacher’s
message.
—MN 56
Part of what makes the arising of the Dhamma eye such a powerful
experience is that the realization that “Whatever is subject to origination is all
subject to cessation” must follow on a glimpse of what stands in opposition to
“all that is subject to origination,” i.e., a glimpse of the Unconditioned—
deathlessness.
[Immediately after attaining the stream] Sariputta the wanderer went to
Moggallana the wanderer. Moggallana the wanderer saw him coming from afar
and, on seeing him, said, “Your faculties are bright, my friend; your
complexion pure & clear. Could it be that you have attained the Deathless?”
“Yes, my friend, I have….”
—Mv I.23.5
The connection between Ven. Assaji’s verse above, discussing causation, and
the arising of the Dhamma eye in Sariputta suggests that realization conveyed
by the Dhamma eye is not just an insight into the fleeting, impermanent
nature of ordinary experience. Instead, it extends also to a realization of the
43
conditioned, dependent nature of that experience. Other passages describing in
more detail the knowledge of a stream-enterer—one who has entered the
stream—show that this is in fact the case. The Dhamma eye sees that things
arise and pass away in line with a particular type of causality, in which the
effects of causes are felt immediately or over the course of time.
“And which is the noble method that he has rightly seen & rightly ferreted
out through discernment?
“There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices:
“When this is, that is.
“From the arising of this comes the arising of that.
“When this isn’t, that isn’t.
“From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.
“In other words:
“From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.
“From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.
“From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&-form.
“From name-&-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.
“From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.
“From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.
“From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.
“From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.
“From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.
“From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.
“From birth as a requisite condition, then aging & death, sorrow,
lamentation, pain, distress, & despair come into play. Such is the origination of
this entire mass of stress & suffering.
“Now from the remainderless fading & cessation of that very ignorance
comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications comes
the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness comes the
cessation of name-&-form. From the cessation of name-&-form comes the
cessation of the six sense media. From the cessation of the six sense media
comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact comes the
cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of
craving. From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of
clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the
44
cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of
birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging & death, sorrow, lamentation,
pain, distress, & despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of
stress & suffering.
“This is the noble method that he has rightly seen & rightly ferreted out
through discernment.”
—AN 10:92
“When a disciple of the noble ones has seen well with right discernment
this dependent co-arising & these dependently co-arisen phenomena as they
are actually present, it is not possible that he would run after the past,
thinking, ‘Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How
was I in the past? Having been what, what was I in the past?’ or that he would
run after the future, thinking, ‘Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the
future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future? Having been
what, what shall I be in the future?’ or that he would be inwardly perplexed
about the immediate present, thinking, ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am
I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?’ Such a thing is not
possible. Why is that? Because the disciple of the noble ones has seen well with
right discernment this dependent co-arising & these dependently co-arisen
phenomena as they are actually present.”
—SN 12:20
The insight of a stream-enterer into the truths of causality on the one hand,
and of the Deathless on the other, is accurate as far as it goes, but it does not
equal the intensity of the insight of the arahant—one who has reached the
final level of awakening. The differences between the two are suggested in the
following simile.
[Ven. Narada:] “My friend, although I have seen properly with right
discernment, as it actually is present, that ‘The cessation of becoming is
Unbinding,’ still I am not an arahant whose effluents are ended. It’s as if there
were a well along a road in a desert, with neither rope nor water bucket. A man
would come along overcome by heat, oppressed by the heat, exhausted,
dehydrated, & thirsty. He would look into the well and would have knowledge
of ‘water,’ but he would not dwell touching it with his body. In the same way,
although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present,
that ‘The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,’ still I am not an arahant whose
effluents are ended.”
—SN 12:68
45
The Three Fetters
The four levels of Awakening are defined by the extent to which they cut the
ten fetters by which the mind binds itself to conditioned experience.
“And which are the five lower fetters? Self-identity views, uncertainty,
grasping at habits & practices, sensual desire, & ill will. These are the five lower
fetters. And which are the five higher fetters? Passion for form, passion for
what is formless, conceit, restlessness, & ignorance. These are the five higher
fetters.”
—AN 10:13
“In this community of monks there are monks who are arahants, whose
effluents are ended, who have reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down
the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and
who are released through right gnosis….
“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the total ending
of the five lower fetters, are due to be reappear [in the Pure Abodes], there to
be totally unbound, never again to return from that world….
“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the total ending
of [the first] three fetters, and with the attenuation of passion, aversion, &
delusion, are once-returners, who—on returning only one more time to this
world—will make an ending to stress….
“In this community of monks there are monks who, with the total ending
of [the first] three fetters, are stream-winners, steadfast, never again destined
for states of woe, headed for self-awakening.”
—MN 118
For the stream-enterer, the arising of the Dhamma eye—with its insight
into the causal principles underlying the origination and cessation of stress—is
what cuts through the first three fetters.
“He attends appropriately, This is stress… This is the origination of stress…
This is the cessation of stress… This is the way leading to the cessation of stress. As he
attends appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: selfidentity view, doubt, and grasping at habits & practices.”
—MN 2
The Canon contains passages that amplify what it means to cut the first
46
three of these fetters. First, self-identity views:
[Visakha:] “But, lady, how does self-identity come about?”
[Sister Dhammadinna:] “There is the case, friend Visakha, where an
uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person—who has no regard for noble ones, is not
well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for men of
integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma—assumes form
(the body) to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self,
or the self as in form.
“He assumes feeling to be the self….
“He assumes perception to be the self….
“He assumes fabrications to be the self….
“He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing
consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness.
This is how self-identity comes about.”
[Visakha:] “But, lady, how does self-identity not come about?”
[Sister Dhammadinna:] “There is the case where a well-instructed disciple
of the noble ones—who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed & disciplined
in their Dhamma; who has regard for men of integrity, is well-versed &
disciplined in their Dhamma—does not assume form to be the self, or the self
as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form.
“He does not assume feeling to be the self….
“He does not assume perception to be the self….
“He does not assume fabrications to be the self….
“He does not assume consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing
consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness.
This is how self-identity does not come about.”
—MN 44
[Visakha:] “‘The origination of self-identity, the origination of self-identity,’
it is said, lady. Which origination of self-identity is described by the Blessed
One?”
[Sister Dhammadinna:] “The craving that makes for further becoming—
accompanied by passion & delight, relishing now here & now there—i.e.,
craving for sensual pleasure, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming:
This, friend Visakha, is the origination of self-identity described by the Blessed
One.”
47
[Visakha:] “‘The cessation of self-identity, the cessation of self-identity,’ it is
said, lady. Which cessation of self-identity is described by the Blessed One?”
[Sister Dhammadinna:] “The remainderless fading & cessation,
renunciation, relinquishment, release, & letting go of that very craving: This,
friend Visakha, is the cessation of self-identity described by the Blessed One.”
[Visakha:] “‘The way of practice leading to the cessation of self-identity, the
way of practice leading to the cessation of self-identity,’ it is said, lady. Which
way of practice leading to the cessation of self-identity is described by the
Blessed One?”
[Sister Dhammadinna:] “Precisely this noble eightfold path—right view,
right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness, right concentration: This, friend Visakha, is the way of practice
leading to the cessation of self-identity described by the Blessed One.”
—MN 44
[Ven. Ananda:] “What is the noble liberation?”
[The Buddha:] “There is the case, Ananda, where a disciple of the noble
ones considers this: ‘Sensuality here & now; sensuality in lives to come; sensual
perceptions here & now; sensual perceptions in lives to come; forms here &
now; forms in lives to come; form-perceptions here & now; form-perceptions
in lives to come; perceptions of the imperturbable; perceptions of the
dimension of nothingness; perceptions of the dimension of neither perception
nor non-perception: that is an identity, to the extent that there is an identity.
This is deathless: the liberation of the mind through lack of
clinging/sustenance.’”
—MN 106
“Magandiya, it is just as if there were a blind man who couldn’t see black
objects… white… blue… yellow… red… the sun or the moon. Now suppose
that a certain man were to take a grimy, oil-stained rag and fool him, saying,
‘Here, my good man, is a white cloth—beautiful, spotless, & clean.’ The blind
man would take it and wear it.
“Then suppose his friends, companions, & relatives took him to a doctor,
and the doctor treated him with medicine: purges from above & purges from
below, ointments & counter-ointments, and treatments through the nose. And
thanks to the medicine his eyesight would appear & grow clear. Then together
with the arising of his eyesight, he would abandon whatever passion & delight
he felt for that grimy, oil-stained rag. And he would regard that man as an
enemy & no friend at all, and think that he deserved to be killed. ‘My gosh,
how long have I been fooled, cheated, & deceived by that man & his grimy, oil48
stained rag!—“Here, my good man, is a white cloth—beautiful, spotless, &
clean.”’
“In the same way, Magandiya, if I were to teach you the Dhamma—this
freedom from Disease, this Unbinding—and you on your part were to
understand that freedom from Disease and see that Unbinding, then together
with the arising of your eyesight, you would abandon whatever passion &
delight you felt with regard for the five aggregates for sustenance. And it would
occur to you, ‘My gosh, how long have I been fooled, cheated, & deceived by
this mind! For in clinging, it was just form that I was clinging to…it was just
feeling… just perception… just fabrications… just consciousness that I was
clinging to. With my clinging as condition, there is becoming… birth… aging
& death… sorrow, lamentation, pains, distresses, & despairs all come into play.
And thus is the origination of this entire mass of stress.’”
—MN 75
In the following passage, Ven. Khemaka—a monk who has attained the
level of non-returner, and so has cut the first five fetters—indicates how selfidentity views may be cut even though the mind has yet to cut the conceit, “I
am,” which ends only at the level of full awakening.
[Ven. Khemaka:] “Friends, it’s not that I say ‘I am form,’ nor do I say ‘I am
something other than form.’ It’s not that I say, ‘I am feeling… perception…
fabrications… consciousness,’ nor do I say, ‘I am something other than
consciousness.’ With regard to these five clinging-aggregates, ‘I am’ has not
been overcome, although I don’t assume that ‘I am this.’
“It’s just like the scent of a blue, red, or white lotus: If someone were to call
it the scent of a petal or the scent of the color or the scent of a filament, would
he be speaking correctly?”
“No, friend.”
“Then how would he describe it if he were describing it correctly?”
“As the scent of the flower: That’s how he would describe it if he were
describing it correctly.”
“In the same way, friends, it’s not that I say ‘I am form,’ nor do I say ‘I am
other than form.’ It’s not that I say, ‘I am feeling… perception… fabrications…
consciousness,’ nor do I say, ‘I am something other than consciousness.’ With
regard to these five clinging-aggregates, ‘I am’ has not been overcome, although
I don’t assume that ‘I am this.’”
—SN 22:89
49
The fetter of uncertainty is defined as doubt in the Awakening of the
Buddha, the truth of his Dhamma, and the practice of his noble disciples.
What this uncertainty boils down to is doubt as to whether there is a Deathless
dimension, and whether one can realize it through one’s own efforts. The
experience of the Deathless—following on the practice of the Dhamma to the
point of entering the stream—cuts this fetter by confirming the possibility of a
human being’s awakening to the Deathless, the correctness of the Buddha’s
teaching as a guide to entering the stream, and the worthiness of those who
have reached the stream.
“There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with
verified confidence in the Awakened One: ‘Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy
and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge & conduct, well-gone,
an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit
to be tamed, the Teacher of devas & human beings, awakened, blessed.’
“He is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma: ‘The Dhamma is
well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here & now, timeless, inviting
verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.’
“He is endowed with verified confidence in the Sangha: ‘The Sangha of the
Blessed One’s disciples who have practiced well… who have practiced straightforwardly… who have practiced methodically… who have practiced
masterfully—in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as
pairs, the eight when taken as individual types
1—they are the Sangha of the
Blessed One’s disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of
offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.’”
NOTE

1. The four pairs are (1) the person on the path to stream entry, the person
experiencing the fruit of stream entry; (2) the person on the path to once-returning,
the person experiencing the fruit of once-returning; (3) the person on the path to nonreturning, the person experiencing the fruit of non-returning; (4) the person on the
path to arahantship, the person experiencing the fruit of arahantship. The eight
individuals are the eight types forming these four pairs.
—AN 10:92
The fetter of grasping at habits and practices is often described in the Pali
Canon with reference to the view that one becomes pure simply through
performing rituals or patterns of behavior. This view in turn is related to the
notion that one’s being is defined by one’s actions: If one acts in accordance
with clearly defined habits and practices, one is ipso facto pure. Although the
50
Canon recognizes the importance of habits and practices in the attaining the
stream, the experience of the Deathless shows the person who has attained the
stream that one cannot define oneself in terms of those habits and practices.
Thus one continues to follow virtuous practices, but without defining oneself in
terms of them.
“Now where do skillful habits cease without trace? Their cessation, too, has
been stated: There is the case where a monk is virtuous, but not fashioned of
(or: defined by his) virtue. He discerns, as it actually is, the awareness-release &
discernment-release where his skillful habits cease without trace.”
—MN 78
[The enlightened person] doesn’t speak of purity
in terms of view,
learning,
knowledge,
habit or practice.
Nor is it found by a person
through lack of view,
of learning,
of knowledge,
of habit or practice.
Letting these go, without grasping,
one is independent,
at peace.
—Sn 4:9
The Character of a Stream-winner
A standard formula in the Canon describes a stream-enterer in terms of
four factors. The first three of these four factors of stream entry are directly
related to the cutting of the fetter of uncertainty. The fourth is related to the
cutting of the fetter of grasping at habits and practices.
“There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with
verified confidence in the Awakened One… verified confidence in the
Dhamma… verified confidence in the Sangha…. He/she is endowed with
virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted,
unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to
51
concentration.”
—AN 10:92
Although this is the standard list of the four factors of stream entry, there
are other lists that replace the fourth factor with other factors.
SN 55:32 defines the fourth factor as follows: “Furthermore, the disciple of
the noble ones lives at home with an awareness cleansed of the stain of
stinginess, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous,
responsive to requests, delighting in the distribution of alms.
SN 55:33 defines it as follows: “Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones
is discerning, endowed with discernment of arising & passing away—noble,
penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress.”
When these lists are collated, we arrive at four qualities that describe a
stream-enterer: conviction, virtue, generosity, and discernment. AN 8:54
describes these as “four qualities that lead to a lay person’s happiness and wellbeing in lives to come.” Other passages in the Canon explore the implications
of each of these four as embodied in a stream-enterer’s behavior.
Conviction in the Triple Gem of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha is not
simply a matter of belief or devotion. It forces one to place trust in the principle
of kamma—the principle of action and result in line with which one first
gained entry to the stream.
“Endowed with these five qualities, a lay follower is a jewel of a lay
follower, a lotus of a lay follower, a fine flower of a lay follower. Which five?
He/she has conviction; is virtuous; is not eager for protective charms &
ceremonies; trusts kamma, not protective charms & ceremonies; does not
search for recipients of his/her offerings outside [of the Sangha], and gives
offerings here first.”
—AN 5:175
Virtue, as practiced by the stream-enterer, is also a function of a deep trust
in the principle of kamma, and of a sympathy for others that arises from that
trust. Although stream-enterers may still break the minor rules of training, the
depth of insight that informs their virtue ensures that their adherence to the
basic principles of morality is unshakable.
“There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones reflects thus: ‘I love life
and don’t love death. I love happiness and abhor pain. Now if I—loving life
and not loving death, loving happiness and abhorring pain—were to be killed,
52
that would be displeasing & disagreeable to me. And if I were to kill another
who loves life and doesn’t love death, who loves happiness and abhors pain,
that would be displeasing & disagreeable to the other. What is displeasing &
disagreeable to me is displeasing & disagreeable to others. How can I inflict on
others what is displeasing & disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting in this way, he
refrains from taking life, gets others to refrain from taking life, and speaks in
praise of refraining from taking life. In this way his bodily behavior is pure in
three ways.
“Furthermore, he reflects thus: ‘If someone, by way of theft, were to take
from me what I haven’t given, that would be displeasing & disagreeable to
me…. If someone were to commit adultery with my wives, that would be
displeasing & disagreeable to me…. If someone were to damage my well-being
with a lie, that would be displeasing & disagreeable to me…. If someone were
to divide me from my friends with divisive speech, that would be displeasing &
disagreeable to me…. If someone were to address me with harsh speech, that
would be displeasing & disagreeable to me…. If someone were to address me
with idle chatter, that would be displeasing & disagreeable to me. And if I were
to address another with idle chatter, that would be displeasing & disagreeable
to the other. What is displeasing & disagreeable to me is displeasing &
disagreeable to others. How can I inflict on others what is displeasing &
disagreeable to me?’ Reflecting in this way, he refrains from idle chatter, gets
others to refrain from idle chatter, and speaks in praise of refraining from idle
chatter. In this way his verbal behavior is pure in three ways.”
—SN 55:7
“Monks, this recitation of more than 150 training rules comes every
fortnight, in reference to which sons of good families desiring the goal train
themselves. There are these three trainings under which all that is gathered.
Which three? The training in heightened virtue, the training in heightened
mind, the training in heightened discernment. These are the three trainings
under which all that is gathered.
“There is the case where a monk is wholly accomplished in virtue,
moderately accomplished in concentration, and moderately accomplished in
discernment. With reference to the lesser and minor training rules, he falls into
offenses and rehabilitates himself. Why is that? Because I have not declared
that to be a disqualification in these circumstances. But as for the training rules
that are basic to the holy life and proper to the holy life, he is one of
permanent virtue, one of steadfast virtue. Having undertaken them, he trains in
reference to the training rules. With the wasting away of [the first] three fetters,
he is a stream-winner, never again destined for states of woe, certain, headed
53
for self-awakening.”
—AN 3:87
Generosity is actually a characteristic that must precede stream entry.
However, the attainment of stream entry gives generosity a distinctive integrity.
“Monks, there are these five forms of stinginess. Which five? Stinginess as to
one’s monastery [lodgings], stinginess as to one’s family [of supporters],
stinginess as to one’s gains, stinginess as to one’s status, and stinginess as to the
Dhamma. These are the five forms of stinginess. And the meanest of these five
is this: stinginess as to the Dhamma….
“Without abandoning these five things, one is incapable of realizing the
fruit of stream entry.”
—AN 5:254, —AN 5:257
“Without abandoning these five things, one is incapable of realizing the
fruit of stream entry. Which five? Stinginess as to one’s monastery [lodgings],
stinginess as to one’s family [of supporters], stinginess as to one’s gains,
stinginess as to one’s status, and ingratitude.”
—AN 5:259
“These five are a person of integrity’s gifts. Which five? A person of integrity
gives a gift with a sense of conviction. A person of integrity gives a gift
attentively. A person of integrity gives a gift in season. A person of integrity
gives a gift with an empathetic heart. A person of integrity gives a gift without
adversely affecting himself or others.”
—AN 5:148
Discernment is the character trait of the stream-enterer that is most directly
related to the cutting of the fetter of self-identity views. However, its
implications spread to other facets of right view as well. In fact, “consummate
in view” is one of the epithets for a stream-enterer. The impact of being
consummate in view extends, not only to one’s intellectual life, but also to one’s
emotional life as well.
“There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the root
of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, considers thus: ‘Is there any internal
enthrallment unabandoned in me that, enthralled with which, my enthralled
mind would not know or see things as they actually are?’ If a monk is
enthralled with sensual passion, then his mind is enthralled. If he is enthralled
54
with ill will, then his mind is enthralled. If he is enthralled with sloth and
torpor, then his mind is enthralled. If he is enthralled with restlessness and
anxiety, then his mind is enthralled. If he is enthralled with uncertainty, then
his mind is enthralled. If a monk is absorbed in speculation about this world,
then his mind is enthralled. If a monk is absorbed in speculation about the
other world, then his mind is enthralled. If a monk is given to arguing and
quarreling and disputing, stabbing others with weapons of the mouth, then his
mind is enthralled.
“He discerns that, ‘There is no enthrallment unabandoned in me that,
enthralled with which, my enthralled mind would not know and see things as
they actually are. My mind is well directed for awakening to the truths.’ This is
the first knowledge attained by him that is noble, transcendent, not held in
common with run-of-the-mill people.
“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus: ‘When I
cultivate, develop, and pursue this view, do I personally obtain tranquility, do I
personally obtain Unbinding?’
“He discerns that, ‘When I cultivate, develop, and pursue this view, I
personally obtain tranquility, I personally obtain Unbinding.’ This is the
second knowledge attained by him that is noble, transcendent, not held in
common with run-of-the-mill people.
“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus: ‘Is there,
outside of this [Dhamma & Vinaya], any other contemplative or brahman
endowed with the sort of view with which I am endowed?’
“He discerns that, ‘There is no other contemplative or brahman outside [the
Dhamma & Vinaya] endowed with the sort of view with which I am endowed.’
This is the third knowledge attained by him that is noble, transcendent, not
held in common with run-of-the-mill people.
“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus: ‘Am I endowed
with the character of a person consummate in view?’ What is the character of a
person consummate in view? This is the character of a person consummate in
view: Although he may commit some kind of offence for which a means of
rehabilitation has been laid down, still he immediately confesses, reveals, and
discloses it to the Teacher or to wise companions in the holy life; having done
that, he undertakes restraint for the future. Just as a young, tender infant lying
on his back, when he has hit a live ember with his hand or his foot,
immediately draws back; in the same way, this is the character of a person
consummate in view: although he may commit some kind of offence for
which a means of rehabilitation has been laid down, still he immediately
confesses, reveals, and discloses it to the Teacher or to wise companions in the
55
holy life; having done that, he undertakes restraint for the future.
“He discerns that, ‘I am endowed with the character of a person
consummate in view.’ This is the fourth knowledge attained by him that is
noble, transcendent, not held in common with run-of-the-mill people.
“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus: ‘Am I endowed
with the character of a person consummate in view?’ What is the character of a
person consummate in view? This is the character of a person consummate in
view: although he may be active in the various affairs of his companions in the
holy life, he still has a keen regard for training in heightened virtue, training in
heightened mind, & training in heightened discernment. Just as a cow with a
new calf watches after her calf all the while she is grazing on grass, in the same
way, this is the character of a person consummate in view: Although he may be
active in the various affairs of his companions in the holy life, he still has a
keen regard for training in heightened virtue, training in heightened mind, &
training in heightened discernment.
“He discerns that, ‘I am endowed with the character of a person
consummate in view.’ This is the fifth knowledge attained by him that is noble,
transcendent, not held in common with run-of-the-mill people.
“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus: ‘Am I endowed
with the strength of a person consummate in view?’ What is the strength of a
person consummate in view? This is the strength of a person consummate in
view: When the Dhamma & Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathagata is being
taught, he heeds it, gives it attention, engages it with all his mind, hears the
Dhamma with eager ears.
“He discerns that, ‘I am endowed with the strength of a person
consummate in view.’ This is the sixth knowledge attained by him that is
noble, transcendent, not held in common with run-of-the-mill people.
“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones considers thus: ‘Am I endowed
with the strength of a person consummate in view?’ What is the strength of a
person consummate in view? This is the strength of a person consummate in
view: When the Dhamma & Vinaya proclaimed by the Tathagata is being
taught, he gains understanding in the meaning, gains understanding in the
Dhamma, gains gladness connected with the Dhamma.
“He discerns that, ‘I am endowed with the strength of a person
consummate in view.’ This is the seventh knowledge attained by him that is
noble, transcendent, not held in common with run-of-the-mill people.
“A disciple of the noble ones thus possessed of seven factors has well
examined the character for the realization of the fruit of stream entry. A
56
disciple of the noble ones thus possessed of seven factors is endowed with the
fruit of stream entry.”
—MN 48
“There is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing
at the level of a learner, can discern that ‘I am a learner,’ and whereby a monk
who is an adept [i.e., an arahant], standing at the level of an adept, can discern
that ‘I am an adept.’
“And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner,
standing at the level of a learner, can discern that ‘I am a learner’? There is the
case where a monk is a learner. He discerns, as it actually is, that ‘This is
stress… This is the origination of stress… This is the cessation of stress… This
is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.’ This is a manner of
reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner,
can discern that ‘I am a learner.’
“Furthermore, the monk who is a learner reflects, ‘Is there outside of this
[Dhamma & Vinaya] any contemplative or brahman who teaches the true,
genuine, & accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One?’ And he discerns, ‘No,
there is no contemplative or brahman outside of this Dhamma & Vinaya who
teaches the true, genuine, & accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One.’ This too
is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the
level of a learner, can discern that ‘I am a learner.’
“Furthermore, the monk who is a learner discerns the five faculties: the
faculty of conviction… persistence… mindfulness… concentration…
discernment. He sees clear through with discernment their destiny, excellence,
rewards, & consummation, but he does not touch them with his body. This too
is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the
level of a learner, can discern that ‘I am a learner.’
“And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept,
standing at the level of an adept, can discern that ‘I am an adept’? There is the
case where a monk who is an adept discerns the five faculties: the faculty of
conviction… persistence… mindfulness… concentration… discernment. He
touches with his body and sees clear through with discernment what their
destiny, excellence, rewards, & consummation are. This is a manner of
reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept,
can discern that ‘I am an adept.’
“Furthermore, the monk who is an adept discerns the six sense faculties: the
faculty of the eye… ear… nose… tongue… body… intellect. He discerns,
‘These six sense faculties will disband entirely, everywhere, & in every way
57
without remainder, and no other set of six sense faculties will arise anywhere
or in any way.’ This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an
adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that ‘I am an adept.’”
—SN 48:53
Then Anathapindika the householder went to where the wanderers of other
persuasions were staying. On arrival he greeted them courteously. After an
exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting
there, the wanderers said to him, “Tell us, householder, what views the
contemplative Gotama has.”
“Venerable sirs, I don’t know entirely what views the Blessed One has.”
“Well, well. So you don’t know entirely what views the contemplative
Gotama has. Then tell us what views the monks have.”
“I don’t even know entirely what views the monks have.”
“So you don’t know entirely what views the contemplative Gotama has or
even that the monks have. Then tell us what views you have.”
“It wouldn’t be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have. But
please let the venerable ones expound each in line with his position, and then
it won’t be difficult for me to expound to you what views I have.”
When this had been said, one of the wanderers said to Anathapindika the
householder, “The cosmos is eternal. Only this is true; anything otherwise is
worthless. This is the sort of view I have.”
Another wanderer said to Anathapindika, “The cosmos is not eternal. Only
this is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have.”
Another wanderer said, “The cosmos is finite…”…”The cosmos is
infinite…”…”The soul & the body are the same…”…”The soul is one thing and the
body another…”…”After death a Tathagata exists…”…”After death a Tathagata does
not exist…”…”After death a Tathagata both does & does not exist…”…”After death
a Tathagata neither does nor does not exist. Only this is true; anything otherwise is
worthless. This is the sort of view I have.”
When this had been said, Anathapindika the householder said to the
wanderers, “As for the venerable one who says, ‘The cosmos is eternal. Only this
is true; anything otherwise is worthless. This is the sort of view I have,” his
view arises from his own inappropriate attention or in dependence on the
words of another. Now this view has been brought into being, is fabricated,
willed, dependently originated. Whatever has been brought into being, is
fabricated, willed, dependently originated, that is inconstant. Whatever is
inconstant is stress. This venerable one thus adheres to that very stress, submits
58
himself to that very stress.” [Similarly with the other positions.]
When this had been said, the wanderers said to Anathapindika the
householder, “We have each & every one expounded to you in line with our
own positions. Now tell us what views you have.”
“Whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently
originated, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is
stress is not me, is not what I am, is not my self. This is the sort of view I have.”
“So, householder, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated,
willed, dependently originated, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is
stress. You thus adhere to that very stress, submit yourself to that very stress.”
“Venerable sirs, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed,
dependently originated, that is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress.
Whatever is stress is not me, is not what I am, is not my self. Having seen this
well with right discernment as it actually is present, I also discern the higher
escape from it as it actually is present.”
When this was said, the wanderers fell silent, abashed, sitting with their
shoulders drooping, their heads down, brooding, at a loss for words.
Anathapindika the householder, perceiving that the wanderers were silent,
abashed…at a loss for words, got up & went to the Blessed One. On arrival,
having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting
there, he told the Blessed One the entirety of his conversation with the
wanderers.
[The Blessed One said:] “Well done, householder. Well done. That is how
you should periodically & righteously refute those foolish men.” Then he
instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged Anathapindika the householder
with a talk on Dhamma. When Anathapindika the householder had been
instructed, urged, roused and encouraged by the Blessed One with a talk on
Dhamma, he got up from his seat and, having bowed down to the Blessed
One, left, keeping the Blessed One on his right side. Not long afterward, the
Blessed One addressed the monks: “Monks, even a monk who has long
penetrated the Dhamma in this Dhamma & Vinaya would do well, periodically
& righteously, to refute the wanderers of other persuasions in just the way
Anathapindika the householder has done.”
—AN 10:93
Rewards
Many of the passages describing the rewards of stream entry focus on the
59
stream-enterer’s fate after death: He/she will never be reborn on a plane lower
than the human, and will tend to experience exceptional happiness wherever
reborn. As for the number of rebirths remaining for the stream-enterer before
total Unbinding, the texts distinguish three levels of attainment.
“[Some,] with the wasting away of the three fetters, are ‘one-seed-ers’
(ekabijin): After taking rebirth only one more time on the human plane, they
will put an end to stress.
“Or, not breaking through to that, not penetrating that, with the wasting
away of the three fetters they are ‘family-to-family-ers’ (kolankola): After
transmigrating & wandering on through two or three more families [according
to the Commentary, this phrase should be interpreted as ‘through two to six
more states of becoming’], they will put an end to stress.
“Or, not breaking through to that, not penetrating that, with the wasting
away of the three fetters they are ‘seven-times-at-most-ers’ (sattakkhattuparama):
After transmigrating & wandering on among devas & human beings, they will
put an end to stress.”
—AN 3:89
[The Buddha is speaking to Nandaka, the chief minister of the Licchavis,
concerning the factors of stream entry:] “A disciple of the noble ones endowed
with these four qualities is a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for
states of woe, headed for self-awakening.
“Furthermore, a disciple of the noble ones endowed with these four
qualities is linked with long life, human or divine; is linked with beauty,
human or divine; is linked with happiness, human or divine; is linked with
status, human or divine; is linked with influence, human or divine.
“I tell you this, Nandaka, not having heard it from any other contemplative
or brahman. Instead, I tell you this having known, seen, and realized it for
myself.”
When this was said, a certain man said to Nandaka, the chief minister of
the Licchavis, “It is now time for your bath, sir.”
[Nandaka responded,] “Enough, I say, with this external bath. I am satisfied
with this internal bath: confidence in the Blessed One.”
—SN 55:30
The Canon often places great importance on the power of the last mental
state before death in determining one’s future plane of existence. However, the
power of stream entry is so great that it can overcome even a muddled state of
60
mind at death, ensuring that the next rebirth will be a good one.
As he was sitting there, Mahanama the Sakyan said to the Blessed One,
“Lord, this Kapilavatthu is rich & prosperous, populous & crowded, its alleys
congested. Sometimes, when I enter Kapilavatthu in the evening after visiting
with the Blessed One or with the monks who inspire the mind, I meet up with
a runaway elephant, a runaway horse, a runaway chariot, a runaway cart, or a
runaway person. At times like that, my mindfulness with regard to the Blessed
One gets muddled, my mindfulness with regard to the Dhamma… the Sangha
gets muddled. The thought occurs to me, ‘If I were to die at this moment, what
would be my destination? What would be my future course?’”
“Have no fear, Mahanama. Have no fear. Your death will not be a bad one,
your demise will not be bad. If one’s mind has long been nurtured with
conviction, nurtured with virtue, nurtured with learning, nurtured with
generosity, nurtured with discernment, then when the body—endowed with
form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother & father,
nourished with rice & porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing,
dissolution, & dispersion—is eaten by crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, hyenas, or
all sorts of creatures, nevertheless the mind—long nurtured with conviction,
nurtured with virtue, learning, generosity, & discernment—rises upward and
separates out.
“Suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake
of water, where it would break. There the shards & jar-fragments would go
down, while the ghee or oil would rise upward and separate out. In the same
way, if one’s mind has long been nurtured with conviction, nurtured with
virtue, nurtured with learning, nurtured with generosity, nurtured with
discernment, then when the body… is eaten by crows, vultures, hawks, dogs,
hyenas, or all sorts of creatures, nevertheless the mind… rises upward and
separates out.”
—SN 55:21
[Ven. Ananda is speaking to Anathapindika:] “A well-instructed disciple of
the noble ones, when endowed with these four qualities [the factors of stream
entry], has no terror, no trepidation, no fear at death with regard to the next
life.”
—SN 55:27
“Then there is the case of the person who has no doubt or perplexity, who
has arrived at certainty with regard to the True Dhamma. Then he comes down
with a serious disease. As he comes down with a serious disease, the thought
61
occurs to him, ‘I have no doubt or perplexity. I have arrived at certainty with
regard to the True Dhamma.’ He doesn’t grieve, isn’t tormented; doesn’t weep,
beat his breast, or grow delirious. This, too, is a person who, subject to death,
is not afraid or in terror of death.”
—AN 4:184
“Just as it’s not easy to take the measure of the water in the great ocean as
‘just this many pails of water or hundreds of pails of water or thousands of
pails of water or hundreds of thousands of pails of water.’ It’s reckoned simply
as a great mass of water that is unreckonable, immeasurable. In the same way,
when a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with these four bonanzas of
merit, bonanzas of skillfulness [the factors of stream entry], it’s not easy to take
the measure of the merit as ‘just this much bonanza of merit, bonanza of
skillfulness, nourishment of bliss, heavenly, ripening in bliss leading to
heaven, leading to what is agreeable, pleasing, charming, happy, & beneficial.’
It’s reckoned simply as a great mass of merit that is unreckonable,
immeasurable.”
—SN 55:41
“Monks, even though a wheel-turning emperor, having exercised sovereign
lordship over the four continents, on the break-up of the body, after death,
reappears in the good destination, the heavenly world, in the company of the
devas of the Thirty-three, and enjoys himself there in the Nandana grove,
surrounded by a consort of nymphs, supplied and endowed with the five
strings of heavenly sensual pleasure, still—because he is not endowed with
four qualities—he is not freed from [the possibility of going to] hell, not freed
from the animal womb, not freed from the realm of hungry ghosts, not freed
from the plane of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower realms.
“And even though a disciple of the noble ones lives off lumps of almsfood
and wears rag-robes, still—because he is endowed with four qualities—he is
freed from hell, freed from the animal womb, freed from the realm of hungry
ghosts, freed from the plane of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower
realms.
“And what are the four? There is the case where the disciple of the noble
ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One… verified
confidence in the Dhamma… verified confidence in the Sangha…. He/she is
endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones…. He/she is
endowed with these four qualities.
“And between the gaining of the four continents and the gaining of these
four qualities, the gaining of the four continents is not equal to one sixteenth
62
of the gaining of these four qualities.”
—SN 55:1
Sole dominion over the earth,
going to heaven,
lordship over all worlds:
The fruit of Stream entry
excels them.
—Dhp 178
Then the Blessed One, picking up a little bit of dust with the tip of his
fingernail, said to the monks, “What do you think, monks? Which is greater:
the little bit of dust I have picked up with the tip of my fingernail, or the great
earth?”
“The great earth is far greater, lord. The little bit of dust the Blessed One has
picked up with the tip of his fingernail is next to nothing. It’s not a hundredth,
a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth—this little bit of dust the Blessed
One has picked up with the tip of his fingernail—when compared with the
great earth.”
“In the same way, monks, for a disciple of the noble ones who is
consummate in view, an individual who has broken through [to stream entry],
the suffering & stress totally ended & extinguished is far greater. That which
remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to
nothing: it’s not a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth, when
compared with the previous mass of suffering. That’s how great the benefit is
of breaking through to the Dhamma, monks. That’s how great the benefit is of
obtaining the Dhamma eye.”
—SN 13:1
“Suppose, monks, that there were a pond fifty leagues wide, fifty leagues
long, & fifty leagues deep, filled to overflowing with water so that a crow could
drink from it, and a man would draw some water out of it with the tip of a
blade of grass. What do you think? Which would be greater: the water drawn
out with the tip of the blade of grass or the water in the pond?”
“The water in the pond would be far greater, lord. The water drawn out with
the tip of the blade of grass would be next to nothing. It wouldn’t be a
hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth—the water drawn out
with the tip of the blade of grass—when compared with the water in the
pond.”
—SN 13:2

“Suppose, monks, that the great ocean were to go to extinction, to its total
end, except for two or three drops of water. What do you think? Which would
be greater: the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction, to its total
end, or the two or three remaining drops of water?”
“Lord, the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction, to its total
end, would be far greater. The two or three remaining drops of water would be
next to nothing. They wouldn’t be a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundredthousandth—the two or three remaining drops of water—when compared
with the water in the great ocean that had gone to extinction, to its total end.”
“In the same way, monks, for a disciple of the noble ones who is
consummate in view, an individual who has broken through [to stream entry],
the suffering & stress totally ended & extinguished is far greater. That which
remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to
nothing: it’s not a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth, when
compared with the previous mass of suffering. That’s how great the benefit is
of breaking through to the Dhamma, monks. That’s how great the benefit is of
obtaining the Dhamma eye.”
—SN 13:8
Not all of the rewards of stream entry concern one’s fate at death. Many of
them pertain also to the here-and-now.
Then Anathapindika the householder went to the Blessed One and, on
arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side. As he was
sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, “When, for a disciple of the noble
ones, five forms of fear & animosity are stilled; when he is endowed with the
four factors of stream entry; and when, through discernment, he has rightly
seen & rightly ferreted out the noble method, then if he wants he may state
about himself: ‘Hell is ended; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry
ghosts is ended; states of deprivation, destitution, the bad bourns are ended! I
am a stream-winner, steadfast, never again destined for states of woe, headed
for self-awakening!’
“Now, which five forms of danger & animosity are stilled?
“When a person takes life, then with the taking of life as a requisite
condition, he produces fear & animosity in the here & now, produces fear &
animosity in future lives, experiences mental concomitants of pain & despair;
but when he refrains from taking life, he neither produces fear & animosity in
the here & now nor does he produce fear & animosity in future lives, nor does
he experience mental concomitants of pain & despair: for one who refrains
64
from taking life, that fear & animosity is thus stilled.
“When a person steals… engages in illicit sex… tells lies…
“When a person drinks distilled & fermented drinks that cause
heedlessness, then with the drinking of distilled & fermented drinks that cause
heedlessness as a requisite condition, he produces fear & animosity in the here
& now, produces fear & animosity in future lives, experiences mental
concomitants of pain & despair; but when he refrains from drinking distilled &
fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, he neither produces fear & animosity
in the here & now nor does he produce fear & animosity in future lives, nor
does he experience mental concomitants of pain & despair: for one who
refrains from drinking distilled & fermented drinks that cause heedlessness,
that fear & animosity is thus stilled.
“These are the five forms of fear & animosity that are stilled.”
—AN 10:92
“These are the five rewards of conviction in a lay person. Which five?
“When the truly good people in the world show compassion, they will first
show compassion to people of conviction, and not to people without
conviction. When visiting, they first visit people of conviction, and not people
without conviction. When accepting gifts, they will first accept those from
people with conviction, and not from people without conviction. When
teaching the Dhamma, they will first teach those with conviction, and not
those without conviction. A person of conviction, on the break-up of the body,
after death, will arise in a good destination, the heavenly world. These are the
five rewards of conviction in a lay person.
“Just as a large banyan tree, on level ground where four roads meet, is a
haven for the birds all around, even so a lay person of conviction is a haven for
many people: monks, nuns, male lay followers, & female lay followers.”
A massive tree
whose branches carry fruits & leaves,
with trunks & roots
& an abundance of fruits:
There the birds find rest.
In that delightful sphere
they make their home.
Those seeking shade
come to the shade,
those seeking fruit
65
find fruit to eat.
So with the person consummate
in virtue & conviction,
humble, sensitive, gentle,
delightful, & mild:
To him come those without effluent—
free from passion,
free from aversion,
free from delusion—
the field of merit for the world.
They teach him the Dhamma
that dispels all stress.
And when he understands,
he is freed from effluents,
totally unbound.
—AN 5:38
Advice
Although it would be pleasant to conclude this study guide with the above
passages of encouragement, we would probably do better to follow the example
of the Buddha, who directed his last words to his stream-enterer disciples,
encouraging them not to rest content with the rewards awaiting them, but to
maintain instead an attitude of heedfulness.
Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, “Now, then, monks, I exhort
you: All fabrications are subject to decay. Bring about completion through
heedfulness.” Those were the Tathagata’s last words.
—DN 16
“And what is heedfulness? There is the case where a monk guards his mind
with regard to effluents and qualities accompanied by effluents. When his
mind is guarded with regard to effluents and qualities accompanied by
effluents, the faculty of conviction goes to the culmination of its development.
The faculty of persistence… mindfulness… concentration… discernment goes
to the culmination of its development.
—SN 58:56
“And how, Nandiya, does a disciple of the noble ones live heedlessly? There
66
is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified
confidence in the Awakened One…. Content with that verified confidence in
the Awakened One, he does not exert himself further in solitude by day or
seclusion by night. For him, living thus heedlessly, there is no joy. There being
no joy, there is no rapture. There being no rapture, there is no calm. There
being no calm, he dwells in pain. When pained, the mind does not become
concentrated. When the mind is unconcentrated, phenomena do not become
manifest. When phenomena are not manifest, he is reckoned simply as one
who dwells heedlessly.
“Furthermore, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified
confidence in the Dhamma…. verified confidence in the Sangha… virtues that
are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered,
liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration. Content
with those virtues pleasing to the noble ones, he does not exert himself further
in solitude by day or seclusion by night. For him, living thus heedlessly, there
is no joy. There being no joy, there is no rapture. There being no rapture, there
is no calm. There being no calm, he dwells in pain. When pained, the mind
does not become concentrated. When the mind is unconcentrated,
phenomena do not become manifest. When phenomena are not manifest, he
is reckoned simply as one who dwells heedlessly….

arises. In one who has rapture, the body becomes calm. When the body is
calm, one feels pleasure. Feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.
When the mind is concentrated, phenomena become manifest. When
phenomena are manifest, he is reckoned as one who dwells heedfully.

“And what is the individual attained to view? There is the case where a
certain individual does not remain touching with his body those peaceful
liberations that transcend form, that are formless, but—having seen with
discernment—some of his fermentations are ended, and he has reviewed &
examined with discernment the qualities [or: teachings] proclaimed by the
Tathagata. This is called an individual who is attained to view. Regarding this
monk, I say that he has a task to do with heedfulness. Why is that? [I think:]
‘Perhaps this venerable one, when making use of suitable resting places,
associating with admirable friends, balancing his [mental] faculties, will reach
& remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go
forth from home into homelessness, knowing & realizing it for himself in the
here & now.’ Envisioning this fruit of heedfulness for this monk, I say that he
has a task to do with heedfulness.”
—MN 70
“Mahanama, a discerning lay follower who is diseased, in pain, severely ill
should be reassured by another discerning lay follower with four reassurances:
‘Be reassured, friend, that you are endowed with verified confidence in the
Awakened One… verified confidence in the Dhamma… verified confidence in
the Sangha… virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken,
unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading
to concentration.’
“Mahanama, when a discerning lay follower who is diseased, in pain,
severely ill has been reassured by another discerning lay follower with these
four reassurances, he should be asked: ‘Friend, are you concerned for your
mother & father?’ If he should say, ‘I am…,’ he should be told, ‘You, my dear
friend, are subject to death. If you feel concern for your mother & father, you’re
still going to die. If you don’t feel concern for your mother & father, you’re still
going to die. It would be good if you abandoned concern for your mother &
father.’
“If he should say, “My concern for my mother & father has been
abandoned,’ he should be asked, ‘Friend, are you concerned for your wife &
children?’ If he should say, ‘I am…,’ he should be told, ‘You, my dear friend,
are subject to death. If you feel concern for your wife & children, you’re still
going to die. If you don’t feel concern for your wife & children, you’re still
going to die. It would be good if you abandoned concern for your wife &
children.’
“If he should say, “My concern for my wife & children has been
68
abandoned,’ he should be asked, ‘Friend, are you concerned for the five strings
of human sensuality?’ If he should say, ‘I am…,’ he should be told, ‘Friend,
divine sensual pleasures are more splendid & more refined than human
sensual pleasures. It would be good if, having raised your mind above human
sensual pleasures, you set it on the Devas of the Four Great Kings.’
“If he should say, ‘My mind is raised above human sensual pleasures and is
set on the Devas of the Four Great Kings,’ he should be told, ‘Friend, the Devas
of the Thirty-three are more splendid & more refined than the Devas of the
Four Great Kings. It would be good if, having raised your mind above the
Devas of the Four Great Kings, you set it on the Devas of the Thirty-three.’
“If he should say, ‘My mind is raised above the Devas of the Four Great
Kings and is set on the Devas of the Thirty-three,’ he should be told, ‘Friend,
the Devas of the Hours are more splendid & more refined than the Devas of
the Thirty-three… the Contented Devas are more splendid & more refined than
the Devas of the Hours… the Devas Delighting in Creation are more splendid
& more refined than the Contented Devas… the Devas Wielding Power over
the Creations of Others are more splendid & more refined than the Devas
Delighting in Creation… the Brahma world is more splendid and more refined
than the Devas Wielding Power over the Creations of Others. It would be good
if, having raised your mind above the Devas Wielding Power over the
Creations of Others, you set it on the Brahma world.’
“If he should say, ‘My mind is raised above the Devas Wielding Power over
the Creations of Others and is set on the Brahma world,’ he should be told,
‘Friend, even the Brahma world is inconstant, impermanent, included in selfidentity. It would be good if, having raised your mind above the Brahma
world, you brought it to the cessation of identity.’
“If he should say, ‘My mind is raised above the Brahma worlds and is
brought to the cessation of identity,’ then, I tell you, Mahanama, there is no
difference—in terms of release—between the release of that lay follower whose
mind is released and the release of a monk whose mind is released.”
—SN 55:54
“Therefore, Dighavu, when you are established in these four factors of
stream entry, you should further develop six qualities conducive to clear
knowing. Remain focused on inconstancy in all fabrications, percipient of
stress in what is inconstant, percipient of not-self in what is stressful,
percipient of abandoning, percipient of dispassion, percipient of cessation.
That’s how you should train yourself.”
—SN 55:3

Glossary
Arahant: A “worthy one” or “pure one”; a person whose mind is free of
defilement and is thus not subject to further rebirth. A title for the Buddha
and his highest level of noble disciples.
Asava: Effluent; fermentation. Four qualities—sensuality, views, becoming,
and ignorance—that “flow out” of the mind and create the flood of the
round of death and rebirth.
Deva (devata): Literally, “shining one.” An inhabitant of the heavenly realms.
Dhamma: (1) Event; action; (2) a phenomenon in and of itself; (3) mental
quality; (4) doctrine, teaching; (5) nibbana (although there are passages
describing nibbana as the abandoning of all dhammas). Sanskrit form:

which means to burn with a still, steady flame.
Kamma: Intentional act. Sanskrit form: Karma.
Nibbana: Literally, the “unbinding” of the mind from passion, aversion, and
delusion, and from the entire round of death and rebirth. As this term also

experience of Awakening; in others, the final passing away of an arahant.
Sanskrit form: Nirvana.
